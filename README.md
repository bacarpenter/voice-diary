# Thanks!

All of the links to resources that aided us in programing this app are linked in the code, near where they were used.

We would like to give a special thanks to ET Reporter Jackie Willis, who [reported on](https://www.etonline.com/news/166008_kim_kardashian_myspace_page_unearthed) the myspace profile which was the inspiration for our look.
